What are the things we need to take into consideration for computing a monster's
damage output per round?

Well...
 1. Any attack actions it has.
 2. Any bonus actions that do damage.
 3. Any ability that conditionally does damage.
 4. Any ability that passively does damage.
 5. Any legendary actions the monster might have.
 6. Any spells that do damage that the monster may have access to.
